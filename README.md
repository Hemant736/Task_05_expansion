This repository contains my follow-up analysis of the 2025 Syracuse Womenâ€™s Lacrosse season data, expanding on the work from Task 05. The focus is to push beyond simple descriptive statistics and explore how large language models (LLMs), specifically Grok 3 from xAI, can support advanced statistical reasoning, scenario modeling, and coach-relevant strategy generation.

Insights

LLMs can simulate advanced sports analytics but require explicit context and mathematical scaffolding.

Without structured prompts, answers collapse into vague generalities.

With proper framing, Grok 3 provided coach-actionable pathways for performance improvement (e.g., goalie training, possession gains, efficient finishing).
